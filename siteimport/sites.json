In strong winds, it is often safer to top land at TO1 and avoid compression in the gut and the bottom LZ.\nModel aircraft operate near the quarry and use the gully for take-off and landing, so remain vigilant and avoid sudden dynamic manoeuvres when close.\nShare safely with hang gliders: keep clear of the hang glider take-off corridor and never top land directly in front of a hang glider preparing to launch.\nNW in Canterbury can be unpredictable, even if it reads NE at the site.",
